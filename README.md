> Physical laws ordain that the air flowing over the top of the wing must reach the back of the wing (the trailing edge) at the same time as air flowing under the wing.  The curvature of the wing forces air to travel farther across the top surface than across the bottom.  In order to travel the longer distance in the same amount of time, the air passing over the top of the wing must flow faster than the air flowing underneath the wing.  This faster-moving air results in lower air pressure above the wing than below.  The net result is lift...

## This Air Isn't Travelling

You are an average air molecule on a calm, cool morning.  You're just sitting there, about a meter above the ground, minding your own business.  You are bouncing around a bit; you have a lot of companions, and they're all bumping into one another, and into you.

All of a sudden something big and solid slams into you from the side.  You rebound upward, smacking hard into one of your neighbors, who bounces you back downward, but not quite as fast as you'd been moving upward.  After a while you hit the object again.  This time it's more of a sideways collision, without quite so much upward force.

Everybody in the neighborhood got hit.  Some of those below you bounced multiple times, downwards, as the object passed.  Hit, slam down, bounce upward off the neighbors, slam down again, and so on.

You weren't "traveling" anywhere.  You and your neighbors didn't have any destination in mind, and you didn't have to take any particular paths to get there.  You were simply minding your own business when you all got smacked.

You are an average air molecule, on a calm day, hanging just above the runway of a small airport.  You have just been hit by an airplane wing.


## A Slightly More Sensible Explanation

It's pretty meaningless to "explain" lift by stating that faster moving air has lower pressure than slower moving air.  What does that even mean?  If you happen to be a sheet of plywood that gets hit broadside by that fast-moving air, you'd surely perceive it as having plenty of pressure compared to slower-moving air.

Sibley's description may be derived from, say, Bernoulli's experiments, but it has lost the meaning of the original.  It tastes like word salad. 

I think it's a little more useful to think in terms of particles being forced out of the way by a wing, and to think about how they are deflected in aggregate - about the resulting reactive forces on the surfaces of a wing.

Like me you may have been taught that lift is not a result of the direct impact of air onto a flat surface, but that it's all about the shape of the airfoil.  This isn't quite true, either.  A box kite is all flat surfaces, and it can fly.  Your hand, sticking out a car window, can be pushed upward forcefully by the air that it hits.  Angle of attack matters.

The shape of an airfoil does matter, of course, especially to the extent that it affects the ratio of lift (upward force on the foil) to drag ("backward" force on the foil) across the range of flight conditions in which it will be used.  But you *can* get lift from a flat plate.

When you take off in a light airplane, you get a practical idea of the importance of angle of attack.  You start your roll down the runway with minimal back pressure on the yoke that (if you're flying a conventional airplane with a horizontal stabilizer + elevator in the back) controls the deflection angle of the elevator.  You accelerate to rotation speed, a speed at which the upward-angled elevator can generate enough downward force to lever the tail of the airplane down toward the ground.

The rotation of the fuselage also rotates the wing, changing its orientation with respect to the air through which it's moving.  Now its bottom surface hits the wind much like your hand did when it stuck out the car window.  That's when the wing really starts generating lift.  A fair fraction of that lift comes from displacing air downward - from direct pressure, just like your hand felt.

Of course you don't want to rotate too much.  If you did, the wing could become like a flat plate turned broadside to the wind, with most of the force pushing the wing backward rather than upward, and with roiling air thrashing in its wake.
